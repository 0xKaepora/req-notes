- tools
	- banana gun 
	- twitter
		- use lists
		- group every project you're invested in, or looking at investing in, into a list and look for changes --> react to them first 
		- if you were late to a narrative, go back and check accounts that started sharing it first 
			- create a list of these traders
	- new contracts/pair checker
		- checks 95%+ of new contracts deployed on ETH while awake and active
			- wouldn't work as well on SOL due to sheer # of coins launched every hour
				- **ETH still favors the hunter**
		- prefers to buy post-launch after vetting buyers and volume 
	- track volume 
		- charts that fly out of the gate with immediate volume and no info 
		- scouting out reversals on older charts that have died for a while (ex. syncus)
		- charts that recently had a lot of volume and died out but starting to pick up steam again 
		- lots of options
			- dexscreener volume trends on 5min timeframe 
			- yardtools
				- not free and requires some tweaking for your preferences 
	- wallet tracker 
		- Cielo 
		- back-tracking wallets that bought in early in the current runners
		- tracking movement of wallets with a large supply in coins that you're already holding
		- tracking activity of dev wallets that haven't launched and watching their movements
	- launch simulator 
		- preparing to snipe (deadblocks, tax, max wallets, etc.)
		- Otto ETH simulator 
	- checking websites
		- copyscape/who.is to see if website is stolen, copied, registered dates
- vetting process
	- checksums 
		- filter blatant scams
		- understand how they work
		- ProficyPriceBot
			- good for checksums pre-launch and price-checking post-launch
		- DiscoBot (@discobot3) 
	- websites
		- copyscape
		- rug rings
			- a lot of scammers have patterns that are easy to identify 
				- ex. utility scammers that launch coins related to LP farming utility multiple times a day with stolen sites
	- intuition 
		- build up by understanding why/how you got rugged and how to avoid getting rugged in the future (what warming signs did you miss?)
- toughest sections during the competition 
	- the beginning (1-10E)
		- stressful (gas/bribe costs were legitimate portfolio hits)
		- keep trade size very low (5% max per trade)
		- hit shitters early (50-100k max)
			- flip initials asap around 2-4x
				- if the project looks like it has potential, scale out slowly with remainder
		- at small size, 10-100k mcap is the same as 100k-1m mcap for your portfolio but with a lot less buy pressure needed 
		- scalp-heavy until hitting a comfortable trading portfolio 
	- the end (300E+) 
		- biggest challenge is knowing which bags to trim/sell completely and which still had upwards trajectory 
			- **need to forecast upcoming metas and predict how that would affect your bags**
				- ex. BRC-related tokens took off and affected some of his holdings
- biggest mistake (see AMA wrt impatience, buying bottomed tokens instead of new pairs to play narratives)
- biggest edge: experience
	- knowing exactly what to do/check when seeing 30+ buyers on a new coin without any other info 
		- and being able to reach a decision in seconds 
	- getting into a habit/flow of understanding patterns that ruggers tend to use
	- being in established groups with grinders 
	- understanding narratives behind volume spikes on different coins
	- know when to/not to buy 
	- autopilot --> bad habits + losses 
		- put in time + effort and be strict with yourself 
- "better wallets"
	- ETH meta ebbs and flows between (3/3-5/5) utility coins and low/zero tax meme coins 
	- better wallet:
		- good win-rate on the coins that they buy --> generally profitable
		- does not buy many coins --> not really a degen
		- on average buys good coins vs. poor performers
		- tends to holds instead of flipping
		- ex.
			- degen: 0x4ED3f64e235F9A2c10b7d5f05b56d97dFa77d6D1
			- better: 0x213d5Db6d62c0166F800a8116b5f7039B1A8Abd0
	- identify a trend of good wallets buying the lows of a coin
		- join in with them and track their movements 
		- often an initial reversal candle
			- secure initials
			- ride the rest up after 
			- examples:
				- $HRZN: 0x13c4b558f6663329c13c838cc0b5b796f7fc0531
				- $TPAD: 0x5483dc6abda5f094865120b2d251b5744fc2ecb5
				- $4096: 0x4096fc7119040175589387656f7c6073265f4096
- misc.
	- ETH is extra difficult/pvp as of late due to liquidity fragmentation 
		- at the moment, more profitable for low-med bankrolls on chains like sol/avax 
			- *won't always be the case*
				- train your trading skills across various areas e.g. side-chaining
				- always trade to your strength but don't become too set in your ways when the tide changes 
					- always better to be profitable than being right
	- dealing with tilt
		- identify how you react to tilt/losing streaks and mitigate effects as much as possible 
	- comparison: use others' success as motivation
	- experience comes with screentime
		- going through contracts
		- refining workflow
		- needs to become second nature, but need the reps
		- bots can help shallow the curve to be competitive
		- was largely break-even last year, but cleared 8-figs this year 
	- believe in yourself + manifest success
## AMA
- preferred strategy
	- buy right after launch + monitor buyers
	- **bought exclusively 0.05 or 0.1E positions until 10E+**
		- keep risk profile to a max of 10%
- tools
	- DRBT/TUF: contract/deployer checker
		- functions
		- checksums
		- rugs
	- DEXTNewPairsBot: new pairs by dextools
	- Twitter: look for socials 
	- Copyscape: see if website is copied/stolen
- identifying what to buy
	- never buy under 100k MC unless a very good reason for it
	- under 100k
		- observe narrative coins
			- looks for small buys right after live in 10-15k range
		- observe coins that ran hard in prior days but trading poorly now
			- 80-90% from highs 
			- join socials
				- chat to devs
				- ask why it's doing bad
			- utility is a popular narrative 
				- easy to find dips on things that will run in the coming days 
	- criteria
		- wallets
			- **always**
				- are they degens?
				- are they people who don't usually trade as much?
				- fresh wallets that could be connected to the dev?
			- other than narrative trades (e.g. GROK), always have this as your primary focus
			- how to check?
				- he goes through buyers manually in dextools
		- socials
			- what is the project actually about?
			- who is following it?
			- are influencers soft shilling it?
			- is the narrative actually hot at the moment?
		- LP/distribution 
			- too lopsided --> coin doesn't do well in early stages
- risk mgmt
	- comfort level was 10E
		- before this, applied same risk strategy to every trade:
			- **keep your buys small**
				- 0.05-0.15 if port is 1-2E (mind cost of gas)
				- keep buys at low market cap
					- **strictly sub-50k**
				- look for either narrative-based
					- great Elon tweet
					- utility-based
				- *sell half at every 2x*
> preservation of initials is more important than hitting a moonshot at lower portfolio sizes

* *> 10E
	* once at comfort level, shouldn't use previous strategy 
	- relaxed holds much more often
		- how to decide?
			- previous criteria (wallets, socials, LP/distribution) but also the narrative behind something 
				- utility
					- what is this coin's utility?
					- how does it tie into the ecosystem of the utility?
					- what are the market caps of the closest competitors of the coin's utility?
					- is it live?
					- does it work well?
					- how professional is the team?
				- narrative/meme
					- how many follows/new TG members are coming through daily?
						- how active are the socials?
					- how "viral" is the narrative? 
					- is it Elon related or is it a simple meme for the average person to understand?
- vetting for rugs/farms
	- evaluate checksums 
		- see how common the contract actually is 
			- common projects are more likely to rug
		- tools
			- Otto Simulator 
			- Proficy
	- timing 
		- if seeing copy-cat ideas deploying after the original, more likely to be illegitimate 
			- ruggers ride tailwinds 
	- copyscape
		- find repeated scammers that often use stolen websites for these types of things
	- farms have two camps:
		- team spends money and the project does well
			- ex. Aegis AI
		- team pockets the money and slow rugs while doing nothing
	- previous criteria should generally give a good feel for what project owners are doing
	- can add farmer/rugger devs into TG contact list to identify profile changes
	- meme farms
		- all use the same 1 sell a block contract
		- two scenarios
			- snipe the launch and look to scale out if volume is subpar
			- wait out the contract clog and observe buying pressure afterwards
- **sell bad performers, not good ones**
- biggest mistake during competition 
	- swinging FROGE bottom
		- made 0.35E from 2E, but then proceeded to 100x
		- too annoyed to buy back in during the entire run-up 
		- was worth 750k at the top if held 
		- **impatience**
			- narrative was good
			- not many other contracts doing it well at the time 
- narrative plays
	- **often the right play is a bottomed coin that already exists vs. new pairs**
		- meets following criteria:
			- 0 tax
			- burned LP
			- needs to match the name
				- don't gamble NW on fresh farmers aiming to take your money 
- bribing 
	- how many wallets does the banana UI say is sniping?
		- < 10
			- can get in with 0.01-0.05
		- mentally double it for each step higher it goes
		- > 30+ could potentially be A LOT more 
	- max txn
		- double it for each double in % max txn 
		- ex.
			- tip 0.06E for 0.5% of a coin
			- 0.12E for 1%
			- 0.24 for 2%
			- etc. 
		- no max 
			- guessing game to win
			- to mitigate losses, use the banana included setting of MIN % out
				- "if you don't snip n-% of coin with snip, fail"
				- **not enough ppl use this setting**
	- hype
		- is it being posted in ECA groups?
		- did dev announce contract pre-launch?
		- how many maestro hits does it have?
		- how badly (cost) do I want to get into this coin?
		- how much are you willing to lose to ensure you get an entry into this coin and make a significant profit?
	- tax
		- higher the tax, more cautious you must be to break even 
- mental game
	- tilt
		- manifests in different ways for different people
			- req starts buying random stuff without researching them properly and throws a lot of money away (agree with this)
	- be self-analytical and understand when you're on a bad streak --> take a break and persevere 
	- do backtests
		- understand why your previous trades were good or bad 
		- **do mentally simulated buys on things if worried about losing bankroll**
	- a lot of sleepless nights trying to hit a few plays to until hitting his comfort level 
- limit orders
	- no stop loss 
	- limit buy
		- fast moving narrative coins that he really wants to catch dips on 
	- limit sell
		- going to sleep and wanting to take profit at a specific mcap 
- using banana
	- ease of use, especially for sniping 
	- more accurate PnL statements in sell bot
	- fees 
	- mobile (traded majority from his bed lol)
- time investment
	- 7-12+ hours/day 
- copy traders
	- profited from them but not because he wanted to
		- **invests in tokens that have the least current attention with most given upside**
			- copy traders turned plays into something with too much attention and accelerate future buyers and lead to a big PND candle --> messes up the future attention and chart
